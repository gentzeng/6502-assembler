# Running the assembler

In order to run the assembler, first download this repo with
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/gentzeng/6502-assembler.git 
```
or download it as a zip package and unzip it.

After downloading, just open the index.html file in a browser
of your choice. I recommend firefox and chrome.
