<p class="helphead">What is this?</p>
<p class="helptext">
6502asm.com is an online 6502 compiler and emulator written
entirely in JavaScript.  The 6502 CPU was fitted into several 8-bit
computers and gaming consoles in the 1980's, such as the Apple ][,
Nintendo NES and many more.  If you have ever coded assembly on
the C64 (which featured a 6510 CPU), then this should be a walk in the park
for you.  I also firmly believe that this can be an excellent platform for
learning assembly code.

<p class="helphead">Who made this?</p>
<p class="helptext">
The idea, design and code behind this website was done by Stian S&oslash;reng.
</p>

<p class="helphead">Compability</p>
<p class="helptext">
The development platform for this project was a 1.25GHz Mac Mini running MacOSX
10.4.6 with Safari 2.0.3.  It should also work in Internet Explorer version
6+, Opera 8+, and Firefox 1.0+.

<p class="helphead">Missing instructions</p>
<p class="helptext">
All but a few instructions from the 6502 are implemented.  Those left out
are CLI, RTI and SEI - simply because interrupts are not supported (yet).  The
commands will be compiled and executed, but have no effect.  For a complete
list of all available instructions, see<br/>

<p class="helphead">Instruction timing and cycles</p>
<p class="helptext">
The emulator part of this project does not take timing or cycles in
consideration - it simply tries to execute the code as fast as possible.

<p class="helphead">Zero Page hack</p>
<p class="helptext">
On a typical 6502-based machine, you will find the ZP ranging from $00 through 
$FF.  This is the case here as well, except the last two are
<em>read-only</em>:  $FE is a random generator and $FF contains the ASCII
code of the key pressed (or zero if none).  They are not truly RO, you
<em>can</em> overwrite the values, but only until the next value is
generated.

<p class="helphead">The screen and palette</p>
<p class="helptext">
The address space for the screen is from $200 (top left corner) to
$5ff (lower right corner).  For your convenience the screen is  32 by 32
pixels - 1024 in total.  Moving one line down is simply done by shifting
five times to the left.  The palette is a direct rip-off from the C64,
and the colours are as follows:<br />
<br />
<font color="#000000">Black</font> ($0)<br />
<font color="#ffffff">White</font> ($1)<br />
<font color="#880000">Red</font> ($2)<br />
<font color="#aaffee">Cyan</font> ($3)<br />
<font color="#cc44cc">Purple</font> ($4)<br />
<font color="#00cc55">Green</font> ($5)<br />
<font color="#0000aa">Blue</font> ($6)<br />
<font color="#eeee77">Yellow</font> ($7)<br />
<font color="#dd8855">Orange</font> ($8)<br />
<font color="#664400">Brown</font> ($9)<br />
<font color="#ff7777">Light red</font> ($a)<br />
<font color="#333333">Dark gray</font> ($b)<br />
<font color="#777777">Gray</font> ($c)<br />
<font color="#aaff66">Light green</font> ($d)<br />
<font color="#0088ff">Light blue</font> ($e)<br />
<font color="#bbbbbb">Light gray</font> ($f)<br />
<br />
The colors on the screen are always ANDed by $f, so no matter what value you
poke into the memory, you will get one of these colours.

<p class="helptext">
Not as slow as it was a month ago.
